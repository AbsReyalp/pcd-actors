# pcd-actors
A system that implements a simplified [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). The main type of the
system are the following:

 * `Actor`: this type represents an actor, which can receive a message and react accordingly
 * `Message`: the message actors can send each others. A message should contain a reference to the sender actor
 * `ActorRef`: a reference to an instance of an actor. Using this abstraction it is possible to treat in the same way
   local actors and actors that execute remotely
 * `ActorSystem`: an actor system provides the utilities to create new instances of actors and to locate them
